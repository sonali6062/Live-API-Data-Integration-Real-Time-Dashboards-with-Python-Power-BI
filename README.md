# 📊 Live API Data Integration: Real-Time Dashboards with Python & Power BI

This project demonstrates how to build **real-time, interactive dashboards** by fetching data from public APIs, converting it into structured CSV files using **Python**, and visualizing insights with **Power BI**.

The workflow ensures that data is always **fresh, automated, and analysis-ready**, without requiring manual updates.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔄 **Automated Data Collection**: Fetches live data from APIs using Python.
* 📂 **Data Storage**: Converts API responses into CSV files for consistency and reusability.
* 📊 **Visualization**: Creates interactive dashboards in Power BI for socio-economic and health indicators.
* 🌍 **Comparative Insights**: Analyze trends across countries and regions.
* 📈 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Dashboards refresh automatically whenever new data is available.
